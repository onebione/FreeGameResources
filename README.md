# FreeGameResources
resources to help minimize game development cost

We are just going to list a bunch of resources here to help indie game devs make a game and test it out in the market for minimal cost. 
Since most of all games will fail, we want to avoid spending much for each game. 

Example of a resource list here should have a name, date, best possible use. 

Firebase, use their hobbyist plan. Database for community features such as leader board.  DB for user pref, items, powerups.
